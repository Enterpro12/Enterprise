	<h3 id="Professor_FC_heading"> Professor Felician Campean </h3>
	
	Felician is a Professor in Automotive Reliability Engineering and Director of the Automotive Research Centre (since 2012). He holds a PhD in Reliability from Brunel University (1998) and a Mechanical / Manufacturing Engineering Degree from Transilvania University (1990). Worked in the bearings industry before joining Academia as a lecturer in manufacturing automation. Has joined University of Bradford in 1998 as a Research Fellow, and progressed to Senior Research Fellow (2000), Senior Lecturer in Competitive Design (2005), and Professor in 2011. <br><br>Felician has led the Bradford Engineering Quality Improvement Centre (BEQIC) since 2000; BEQIC is a major hub for collaborative applied research and knowledge transfer in product development, with a focus on quality and reliability engineering. He has led several major programmes of workplace based research and postgraduate development including the MSC by research / MPhil / PhD in Engineering Quality Improvement (partnership with Ford Motor Company) and the MSc in Engineering and Process Excellence (partnership with Jaguar Land Rover - Technical Accreditation Scheme) - underpinned by a programme of research led short courses.<br>Since 2012 Felician has been leading the Automotive Research Centre, the University's R&KT Hub for collaboration with the Automotive Industry.<br><br>Felician has established an extensive track record research and knowledge transfer collaboration with the global automotive industry, including companies like Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, BAE Systemns, Tata Motors, Honda, Cummins Turbo Technologies, Webasto, and Gates Corporation.
	
	<br>Current research interests revolve around modelling complex systems, including model based methods for systems engineering, reliability, robustness and resilience analysis for multi-disciplinary complex systems, big data analytics methods for systems design and lifecycle management, multi-disciplinary design optimization applied to complex systems, modelling complex manufacturing and product development processes.<br><br>Major recent research projects have focused on engine and powertrain multidisciplinary modelling and optimisation, automotive model-based systems engineering design based on Failure Mode Avoidance, the use of big data analytics for intelligent personalised powertrain healthcare, model based testing and verification of CPS.

	<h3 id="Professor_DN_heading"> Professor Daniel Neagu</h3>
	
	Daniel Neagu was appointed Professor of Computing in 2011: he joined the Department of Computer Science as Lecturer in 2002, and was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2005. He has previously served as Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Galati, Romania (1993-2001).
	
	<br><br> Daniel received his PhD Cum Laude in Computer Science (2000) at the University of Galati after he obtained a 5-year MEng degree (1990) in Automation and Computer Engineering from Technical University of Iasi and a BSc (Hons) degree (1995) in Information Technology from University of Galati. He spent a research period (1999) at University of Patras, Greece, with Human Computer Interaction Group led by Professor Nikolaos Avouris. After successfully defending his Ph.D. thesis entitled "Using Artificial Neural Networks in Fuzzy Reasoning", Daniel was appointed Research Fellow at Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Italy (2001-2002), where he joined the FP5 European Research Network IMAGETOX (Intelligent Modelling Algorithms for General Evaluation of TOXicities) working with Professor Giuseppina Gini.
	
	<br><br>His research focuses on Artificial Intelligence techniques applied in Toxicology, (Automotive) Engineering, Online Social Networks, Data Quality, Big Data, Healthcare. Daniel's research has been motivated by his desire to advance the AI field by studying systems from rigorous computational perspectives. The main theme throughout his academic work is to develop models of multidisciplinary information systems by the fusion of experts knowledge and digital information. He strongly believes Computer Science is now a media for knowledge representation, exchange and retrieval to serve multidisciplinary objectives and purposes. Mining information to identify key attributes and making unknown, hidden, distributed information accessible to people plays a vital role in the progress of science and technology, thus Daniel's work addresses applications as diverse as health, security and entertainment.
	
	<br><br>Daniel leads the Artificial Intelligence Research Group (AIRe). He is member of IEEE Computer Society and Computational Intelligence Society, ACM Association for Computing Machinery, British Computer Society (BCS The Chartered Institute for IT), and committee member of the BCS SGAI (Specialist Group on Artificial Intelligence) 2011-2013. Daniel Neagu served as the General Chair of <a href="">the 4th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Systems DSS2018, the 14th Annual Workshop on Computational Intelligence UKCI2014 </a> and the series of the International Workshop on Engineering Data- & Model-driven Applications <a href="">EDMA2017</a>, <a href="">EDMA2018</a>, Deputy Technical Programme Chair for BCS SGAI AI Conference in 2011, 2012 and 2013 (Cambridge, UK), and invited editor for the Expert Systems journal special issues in 2011 and 2012, Springer Neural Computing and Applications journal special issue on Predictive Analytics Using Machine Learning in 2014/15, and Springer Soft Computing journal special issue on Computational Intelligence in 2015. He served as external examiner for PhDs, MPhil and MRes for Universities of Aberystwyth, Coventry, East Anglia, Huddersfield, Hull, Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores, Sheffield, Sunderland, Ulster, York, and External Examiner for undergraduate and postgraduate Computer Science degrees at University of Huddersfield. Daniel is invited Expert for EC H2020, IMI, EPSRC and a number of national research councils.
	
	<br><br>Daniel has been accepted on the <a href= "">Higher Education Academy </a> register of practitioners in 2006 and is Fellow of Higher Education Academy since 2007. He contributed to the UKCGE (UK Council for Graduate Education) Postgraduate Funding and Resourcing Working Group (2014-2015).
	
	<br><br>Daniel teaches Big Data Systems and Analytics, Data Mining, Software Design and Development. He has coordinated and re-designed Software Development (at UG and PGT level), Data Structures and Algorithms, Group Project, Data Fusion, Artificial Intelligence with Applications, Computer Architecture and Systems, and Technical & Professional Skills academic modules. He has also delivered modules, presentations and invited training sessions to BBC Academy, NATO training courses, EC FPs consortia schools, and coordinated data hackathons and research seminars series.
